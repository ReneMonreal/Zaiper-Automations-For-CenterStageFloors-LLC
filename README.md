<h2>Open URL to send Webhook</h2>
<p>This python script was created following two steps in my Zaiper Automation Work Flow (Zap)</p>
<p>Built for Center Stage Floors, LLC by Rene Monreal </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Center Stage Floors, LLC has a CRM platfrom known as airtable, first step in the Zapier Automation is to detect when a new record is created or an existing record is updated. Once detected the selected record will then be filtered by Zaipers filtering opion/step for specific requirements. When requirements are meet this python script with run for that follownig record. </p>
<h3>Where are the rest of the variables? </h3>
<p>Following the 2nd step of the automation work flow, when a record meets certain contitions its contents are then presented in a value set zapier has in its software. Once selected from the menu, i can then use them in my line of code.
  
Example: "Webhook" is an input data i assinged on zapier, its value is the Webhook URL. </p>
<h3>What is a Webhook in Zapier?</h3>
<p>First note that in order to send a webhook to zaiper, you must manually open the webhook URL for Zapier to revice its contents. <b><i> What is a webhook? : </i></b> Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. They have a message—or payload—and are sent to a unique URL—essentially the app's phone number or address. Webhooks are usually used to connect apps and systems, allowing them to share real-time data.</p>
